## Branching
Please create your own branch and work on it so we can maintain project flow!

Within your project directory in your machine, write:

git checkout -b <branch-name>

Please replace branch-name with your first name so I know who is working on which branch!
You can add whatever files and work you'd like in this branch.

Once you're done adding all your code. Within your branch write:

git add .
git commit -m "Your custom commit message"

Make sure you commit with a message so I know what you did!
