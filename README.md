## Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine with this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Project-Code-E-Commerce.git
'''

Make sure to fill in yourusername. Otherwise just copy the repo link from github and do git clone
with that url.

## Branching
Please create your own branch and work on it so we can maintain project flow!
Within your project directory in your machine, write:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>

Please replace branch-name with your first name so I know who is working on which branch!
You can add whatever files and work you'd like in this branch.

## Committing Changes
Once you're done adding all your code. Within your branch write:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your custom commit message"

Make sure you commit with a message so I know what you did!

## Push Your Code
Next, you need to push your code to the remote repo:

```bash
git push origin main

## Best Practices
Use these commands each time you update your code in a session to maintain your branch:

git checkout main
git pull
git checkout <your-branch-name>
git merge main
